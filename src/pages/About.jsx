            <h1>About Fractalite</h1>
            <p>
                Fractalite is a digital canvas that harnesses the raw power of
                WebGL to weave breathtakingly intricate fractal art before your
                eyes. This interactive explorer unveils the mesmerizing beauty
                of self-similar, endlessly non-repeating patterns, transforming
                abstract mathematical equations into vibrant, living tapestries
                on your screen. From the hypnotic swirls of 2D classics like the
                Mandelbrot Set to the mind-bending organic complexity of 3D
                fractals like the Mandelbulb, Fractalite brings these
                mathematical wonders to life with stunning clarity and real-time
                interactivity.

                Conceived as an educational tool, Fractalite is more than a
                visual spectacle—it’s a window into the profound principles that
                govern these complex structures. Each fractal, whether a 2D
                masterpiece or a 3D marvel, tells a story of iteration, chaos,
                and order, inviting you to explore the delicate balance of
                mathematics and nature. Zoom into the infinite boundaries of a
                Mandelbrot Set, rotate around the alien landscapes of a
                Mandelbulb, or tweak parameters to uncover new
                patterns—Fractalite empowers you to interact with these concepts
                in a hands-on, intuitive way, making the abstract tangible and
                the complex approachable.
