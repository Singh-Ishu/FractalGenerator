# Fractalite

## The Fractal Generator

### What it does?

Fractalite is an interactive fractal generator that allows users to explore complex mathematical structures such as the Mandelbrot Set, Julia Set, and Burning Ship fractal. It provides dynamic zooming, color customization, and real-time fractal rendering.

### How it works?

Fractalite utilizes WebGL for GPU-accelerated rendering of fractals. The core computation is handled in fragment shaders, enabling high-performance visualization. The project is currently being refactored into React to improve modularity and maintainability.

**Note:** This project is under a major refactor, transitioning to React for better scalability and upgradability.
